# Medi-OLX

Medi-OLX is an innovative platform that is centered around creating an online marketplace where common people and healthcare professionals can buy and sell new or used medical equipment.
We realized that many healthcare providers, particularly those in developing countries or with limited budgets, struggle to afford new medical equipment. 
Meanwhile, there are many healthcare facilities or people in general that have excess or unused equipment that they would be happy to sell to others.
To address this gap, we developed Medi-OLX as a one-stop-shop for all medical equipment needs. The platform allows buyers to browse a wide range of medicines and medical equipment listings.

The Medi-OLX platform was developed using a combination of different software technologies to create a seamless user experience. Flask was used as the web framework, allowing for efficient and scalable development of the platform's backend. MySQL was used as the database management system to store and manage data related to listings, users, and transactions.

In addition to Flask and MySQL, a variety of front-end technologies were used to create the platform's user interface. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript were utilized to create an intuitive and visually appealing design that would attract and retain users. HTML provides the structure of the website, while CSS is used for styling and visual presentation. JavaScript was used for interactivity and dynamic effects.

By providing a simple and user-friendly platform for buying and selling unused medicines and medical equipment, we hope to improve access to quality healthcare for people around the world.
